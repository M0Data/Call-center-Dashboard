## Overview
This call center dashboard is designed to monitor and evaluate the performance of a call center, providing actionable insights into key metrics such as call volume, agent performance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

The dashboard equips managers and stakeholders with a clear view of daily operations, enabling data-driven decisions to enhance customer service quality and improve team performance.

## Key Features
The dashboard is divided into several key sections that focus on different aspects of call center operations:

### 1. **Overall Summary**
At the top, the dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs) for a high-level overview of the call center’s performance:
- **Total Calls:** The total number of calls the call centre handles (5K in this case).
- **Number of Agents:** The total number of active agents (8).
- **Average Speed of Answer:** The average time (in seconds) it takes for agents to answer calls (68 seconds).
- **Average Talk Duration:** The average length of calls (225 seconds).
- **Rate of Answered Calls:** The percentage of incoming calls answered by agents (81%).
- **Rate of Resolved Calls:** The percentage of calls resolved successfully during the interaction (73%).
- **Average Satisfaction Rate:** The average customer satisfaction score (on a scale of 1–5).

### 2. **Call Volume Analysis**
This section provides insights into the volume of calls received:
- **Call Volume by Date:** A line chart visualizing call volume trends over time, showing fluctuations such as reduced volumes in February and March.
- **Calls Made by Each Agent:** This is a bar chart comparing the number of calls handled by each agent. For example, Agent Jim managed the most calls (666), while Stewart handled the fewest (592).
- **Calls Based on Each Topic:** This is a breakdown of calls categorized by topics such as "Admin Support," "Payment Related," and "Streaming." Streaming and Payment-Related topics received the highest number of calls (1,032 and 1,021, respectively).

### 3. **Agent Performance Analysis**
This segment evaluates individual agent performance:
**Resolved Rate of Each Agent:** This chart Highlights resolution rates, with Joe and Stewart leading at 74% and Becky lags slightly at 72%.
- **Average Talk Duration of Each Agent:** Compares average call durations. Dan has the longest duration (281 seconds), while Jim has the shortest (219 seconds).
- **Average Speed of Answer of Each Agent:** Shows efficiency in response times, with Greg answering calls the fastest (63 seconds) and Martha the slowest (73 seconds).

### 4. **Call Handling Efficiency Analysis**
Focused on operational efficiency, this section includes:
- **Average Speed of Answer by Date:** Displays trends in answering speed, showing slight improvements over time.
- **Resolution Rate by Average Talk Duration:** Examines the relationship between talk duration and resolution rates, peaking at moderate durations (~250–300 seconds).
- **Rate of Unanswered Calls by Time Interval:** Highlights time intervals with the highest unanswered call rates, such as 6 AM–6 PM (19%).

### 5. **Topic-Based Analysis**
This section assesses performance based on specific topics:
- **Average Satisfaction Rate of Each Topic:** A bar chart showing satisfaction rates for topics like Admin Support and Payment Issues.
- **Resolution Rate of Each Topic:** Highlights topics with above-average resolution rates, such as Streaming and Contract Issues (74%).

## Insights Gained
From this dashboard, several key insights can be derived:
1. **Agent-Specific Recommendations:** Agents with lower resolution rates or slower answering times (e.g., Martha, Becky) could benefit from targeted coaching.
2. **Operational Adjustments:** Higher unanswered call rates during mornings and afternoons (19%) suggest the need for optimized staffing.
3. **Process Improvements:** Topics like Streaming and Payment-Related show slightly lower resolution rates (~72%), requiring targeted training.
4. **Customer Experience Focus:** Enhancing satisfaction rates for specific topics can lead to improved customer retention.
